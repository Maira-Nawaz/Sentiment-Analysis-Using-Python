# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze sentiments expressed in tweets related to a specific topic or keyword. This analysis provides insights into public opinion and helps monitor sentiments on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, which often exhibits a prevalence of negative opinions during discussions, especially political ones.

## Importance
Sentiment analysis is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP) that enables platforms to identify and address negative sentiments and hate speech within their communities. By conducting regular sentiment analysis, organizations can better understand user opinions and improve the overall user experience.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Collection
The dataset used in this project contains tweets relevant to the chosen topic, stored in a "tweet" column. This column serves as the basis for sentiment analysis.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:
- **Importing Required Libraries**: Libraries such as NLTK, `re` for regular expressions, and `string` for string operations are utilized.
- **Cleaning Tweets**: A function (`clean`) is defined to clean and preprocess the tweets by:
  - Converting text to lowercase for uniformity.
  - Removing URLs, HTML tags, and punctuation.
  - Filtering out common stopwords (e.g., "the," "is," "in") to focus on meaningful words.
  - Applying stemming to reduce words to their base form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
After preprocessing, the sentiment scores of the cleaned tweets are calculated to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The process involves:
- Evaluating the sentiment of each tweet based on predefined criteria.
- Counting the total occurrences of each sentiment type.

### 4. Results Interpretation
The analysis yields insights such as:
- The majority of tweets tend to be neutral, indicating a lack of strong positive or negative sentiment.
- However, there are more negative tweets than positive ones, suggesting an overall negative public opinion on the topic.

### 5. Conclusion
This project highlights the significance of sentiment analysis in understanding public sentiment on social media. The results can aid organizations in identifying users who contribute to negativity and help in developing strategies to improve the community's overall sentiment.

## Usage
To replicate this analysis, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and have access to a dataset of tweets relevant to your topic of interest. Follow the steps outlined in the code to preprocess the data and analyze sentiments effectively.
